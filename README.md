This code implements a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user's and computer's scores are tracked. It uses localStorage to persist the scores and message, ensuring that the game state is retained even after a page refresh. The user can choose their move, and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game. Scores are updated in real-time, and the results (win, lose, or draw) are displayed with appropriate messages.
